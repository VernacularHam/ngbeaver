## NPM Dependencies
The UI has various external dependencies managed by the NPM (Node Package Manager) tool, install them as follows:
* Open the Cmder tool or your preferred command line tool and navigate to where your source has been saved locally.
* Enter the following command 'npm install'
* Wait for all dependencies to finish installing.
* Debugging hint - if you ever have weird issues with building the UI, the basic 'did you plug it in' step is to delete your entire node_modules folder and run a fresh npm install command.
